# Alvaro Alday
- 🫀 Ruby enthusiast.
- 💻 Web Developer.
- 😎 Not afraid of new challenges.
- 🛠️ I like to dream & aim big.

I'm an experienced Ruby on Rails developer and code enthusiast with great interest in beautifully crafted code. 
I love projects that challenge my capacities and force me to be creative. 

### Big fan of:
- Ruby
- Ruby On Rails
- Rspec
- AWS CloudFormation
- AWS Lambda
- AWS EC2
- MySQL
- Redis
...

Some people say Ruby is dead, I'd say the allegations of its death are greatly exaggerated.
